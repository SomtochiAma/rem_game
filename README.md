## How the game goes
The game starts by initially displaying a deck of cards. Then after some time, it flips over.
The project has different functions to handle when the cards match and when it doesn't.
It also uses local storage to store names and number of moves for the leaderboard.
The leaderboard is displayed as a modal when a button is clicked.
